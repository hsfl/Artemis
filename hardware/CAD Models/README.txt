# Artemis Cubesat Kit Hardware

Within this folder are the solidworks files for the Artemis CubeSat.

Models were made using SolidWorks 2020, be sure to have SolidWorks 2020 or up to open the files.
If you do not have access to Solidworks, you can use OnShape to view the model as a zip file.

Due to file size limit, only the structure was uploaded.
